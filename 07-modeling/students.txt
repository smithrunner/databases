2. Data Model for students/classes.

The drawn model for this problem is saved in this folder as "student_reg.png",
it was made using quickdatabasediagrams.com.

The assumptions made are that the only information needed from students are a
name and email. And that a class only needs a capacity, professor, department and
name listed.
