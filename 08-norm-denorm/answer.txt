1. In your own words, explain the benefits of normalization.
Include a real-world scenario where normalization is necessary.

--> Normalization is basically the process of standardizing all of your databases
so that they are more efficient, clean (no redudant data), organized and follow
a standard format. In an ideal world, a normalized database will be faster and more
efficient.

--> If you were making a database of car types, normalization would help you. You would
have a table of car manufacturers. Then for each manufacturer, you would have a table of
each model car they produce. Each model would have a table of stats/whatever you want to record about
that particular car.

2. List and explain the different normal forms and how they relate to one another,
with regard to your real-world scenario in the first question.

--> 1NF. A column cannot contain multiple values. In my first database of manufacturers,
each manufacturerID is only related to 1 maker. EX:

ID | manufacturer | make
---|--------------|-----
01 | ford         | fiesta
01 | ford         | focus
02 | subaru       | outback


--> 2NF. First, the table must be 1NF compliant. Then all non-key attributes cannot be dependent on a subset of the primary key

ID | manufacturer
---|-------------
01 | ford
02 | subaru

manufacturer | make
-------------|-----
ford         | fiesta
ford         | focus
subaru       | outback


--> 3NF. First, everything needs to be 2NF compliant. Then all transitive functional dependencies of non-prime attributes must not exist.

--> BCNF



3. The student_records table below shows the students and their grades in different subjects.
The table is already in first normal form (1NF). Convert this table to the third normal form (3NF)
using the techniques you learned in this checkpoint.

4. In your own words, explain the potential disadvantages of normalizing the data above.
What are its trade-offs? Discuss this with your mentor.

5. Looking at the tables you have normalized. If you need to denormalize to improve query performance or speed up reporting,
how would you carry out denormalization for this database design? Discuss potential strategies with your mentor.

6. Discuss the trade-offs between data normalization and denormalization in this scenario with your mentor.
