1. string, integer, string, float, float

2. A database would be used when you need to save information after an application
has been closed. For example, you can post something to Facebook on your computer,
log out, open up facebook on your phone and boom! there is your post. Your post was
saved to a database so it could be accessed later. A text file is used when your
just need something written out and saved. There could be instructions for humans
saved in a text file, but not for computers.

3. You tell SQL what to do, not how to do it. I can tell SQL, "go get this info"
and SQL will get that info however it does it. If I tried to do the same thing in
Ruby, I would have to tell Ruby step by step how to go grab something.

4. Databases store information into tables made up of rows, columns and values.
These databases can be accessed through the language SQL. The database can be accessed
from multiple places, which is why the data is stored in 1 location.

5.
A table contains rows, column and values
Row: a collection of different data elements for the same item. Example: a row
would contain userid, name, email and date for a single element.
Column: all of the X-data element for every item. Example: a column would contain
the email for every item in the table.
Value: the actual data contained in a row/column element. Example: an email value of
'smithrunner@live.com'
